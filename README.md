My personal Neovim Configuration, Pure Barebones

## This setup is mainly focused on neovim (5.0 or above), so, you'll have to translate both the plugins and the bindings into vimscript.

## If you want to add some modularity or make it glorious feel free to contribute! It helps me a lot, as I still learning lua, little by little
