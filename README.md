My personal Neovim Configuration, Pure Barebones

## UPDATE:
Burrito is deprecated. You can use it to have an idea, but I don't recommend using it anymore. I'm working on a new version that is more up-to-date. My goal is that Pikavim is as self-contained as possible. So, things like the dashboard, the icons, tabline, tabs, filetree be native instead of being from a plugin. I don't want this to be some kind of Nvchad or some kind of Lunarvim, just a small simple neovim config with lua that uses the essencials. Nothing more, nothing less.

### This setup is mainly focused on neovim (5.0 or above), so, you'll have to translate both the plugins and the bindings into vimscript.

### If you want to add some modularity or make it glorious feel free to contribute! It helps me a lot, as I still learning lua, little by little
